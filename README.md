# Ecommerce Data Linear Regression Analysis

## Description

This project leverages linear regression techniques to analyze ecommerce customer data, with the goal of identifying which factors—mobile app usage, website usage, or membership duration—most significantly influence customer spending. By quantifying the impact of each channel, the analysis provides actionable insights to guide business strategy, resource allocation, and product development priorities for maximizing user engagement and retention.



## Business Objective

In this project we work with a dataset available on Kaggle. The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website.
- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website)

The objective is to determine whether the company should focus its efforts on **mobile app development**, **website development**, or prioritize **extending membership time**. By interpreting the coefficients of relevant data, we aim to gain insights into which factor has a greater impact on business growth, ultimately guiding resource allocation and strategic focus for future development.

This analysis will help in making **data-driven decisions** on where to concentrate efforts for maximizing user engagement and retention.
